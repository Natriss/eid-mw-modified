# eid-mw (Pkcs11Net)
This is a modified version of the official eid-mw https://github.com/Fedict/eid-mw

I've created this modified version so it has a bit more accessable so you don't need to read all of the documentation.

This is also a more user-friendly NUGET package.

Everything is accessible via get-only properties and otherwise the GetData() and GetFile() methods are availble if needed.
